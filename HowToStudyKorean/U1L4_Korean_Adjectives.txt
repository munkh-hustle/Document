!! Lesson 4: Korean Adjectives ~ㄴ/은

!! Using Adjectives ~ㄴ/은

? 나는 배를 원하다 = I want a boat
? 나는 big 배를 원하다 = I want a big boat

- eliminate ‘~다’ and add ~ㄴ, ~은, ~는 to the stem of the adjective.
- consonant to ~은
- vowel to ~ㄴ
- ~있다 to ~는

? 크다 > 크 > 큰 > 큰 배 (Big boat)
? 비싸다 > 비싸 > 비싼 > 비싼 음식 (Expensive food)
? 작다 > 작 > 작은 > 작은 남자 (Small man)
? 재미있는 남자 (Funny man)

- The first example is a sentence. The second example is word with adjective.
? 음식은 비싸다 = The food is expensive
? 비싼 음식 = expensive food

!! To be a lot of: 많다
- trying to force the rules/structure of English into Korean is unnatural
? 사람이 많다 = People are a lot of
? 사람이 많다 = there is a lot of people
- some words use ~이/가 on the subject is more natural than ~는/은.

!! Particle ~도
- It has the meaning of “too/as well”

- In English these two are written the same, but sound different when speaking
? 저도 한국어를 말하다 = I speak Korean as well (In addition to other people)
? 저는 한국어도 말하다 = I speak Korean as well (in addition to other languages)
