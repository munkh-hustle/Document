!! Lesson 8: Korean Adverbs, Negative Sentences in Korean

!! Korean Adverbs
- Adverbs = tell you when, where, or to what degree something is being done
- they can essentially be placed at any place in the sentence

- When: I went to work on TUESDAY
- Where: I am INSIDE the house
- Degree: I opened the door QUICKLY

!! When and Where
- when or where something is taking place, you must add the particle 에 to the end of that word
- place에
- time에

!! To what degree/How much
- While other adverbs are generally free to be placed anywhere in a sentence, adverbs like this that indicate a degree to which something is done are typically placed immediately before the verb

? 저는 저의 친구를 자주 만나요 = I meet my friend often
? 저는 밥을 많이 먹었어요 = I ate a lot of food (rice)
? 저는 집에 바로 갔어요 = I went home immediately
? 저는 숙제를 빨리 했어요 = I did my homework quickly

- from their adjective forms to create an adverb
- adding ‘게’ to the stem of an adjective
? 쉽다 = easy	        쉽게 = easily
? 다르다 = different	다르게 = differently
? 비슷하다 = similar	비슷하게 = similarly

- sometimes by changing 하다 to 히
- Kor ppl don’t know "what is the difference 게 and 히"
? 조용하다 = quiet	조용하게/조용히 = quietly

!! Negative Sentences
- two negative sentence types

- By adding 안
- 안 is adverb
? 그 여자는 안 예뻐요 = That girl isn’t pretty

- By adding ~지 않다
? 그 여자는 예쁘지 않아요 = That girl isn’t pretty

!! To not be: 아니다
- 아니다 is the opposite of the word 이다.
- 이다 is always attached directly to a noun
- ~이/가 is attached and 아니다 is used as a separate

!! To not have: 없다
- 없다 is the opposite of 있다

- To not have:
? 저는 돈이 없어요 = I don’t have money
? 저는 시간이 없어요 = I don’t have time
? 우리는 차가 없어요 =  We don’t have a car

- To not be in a location:
? 저의 친구는 지금 한국에 없어요 = My friend is not in Korea now
? 사람이 없었어요 = There was no people
